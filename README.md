### Neural-Network

Building a neural Network from scratch

Implement the following  from scratch:
1. Fully connected Layer
2. ReLU layer
3. Softmax layer
4. Cross entropy loss function

Then create a network with the implemented layers, and test the implemented network on a subset
of the CIFAR100 dataset
